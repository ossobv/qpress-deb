qpress (1:1.1-0osso0+anydist) stable; urgency=low

  * Add epoch, because MariaDB version is already at 11, while we are using
    1.1.
  * Create version that should work on any distro (using +anydist instead of
    +deb10 (for buster)).
  * Build qpress (c++) with -static, so the resultant package depends only on
    libc6 >= 2.14.
  * Build gzipped .deb for maximum compatibility with older debian/ubuntu.

qpress (1.1-0osso1+deb9) stretch; urgency=low

  * Create initial OSSO qpress deb based on percona distro (rename version 11
    in this changelog to 0.11 because we're dealing with 1.1; I hope we can
    avoid adding a debian-epoch in the version).
  * Automate builds using Docker.
  * Add test.sh for really really basic tests after build (before packaging).
  * Use the quicklz libraries 1.5.1 BETA 7 instead of 1.4.1 that came with the
    original qpress.
  * Add qlzip1/qlunzip1/qlzcat (quicklz zip, unzip and zcat) and test those.
    Went with compression level 1, as that seems the most useful.
